 Lilac Latte Lounge — Landing Page (Fake Startup)

A simple one-page HTML/CSS landing page for a pastel-pinterest-style café. Built to be hosted easily via GitHub Pages.

  What did you learn while making this app?
- **CSS layout magic** — using `grid`, responsive queries, and soft visual styling to build that Pinterest café vibe without over-engineering.
- **Visual storytelling** — crafting a mood and aesthetic through fonts, color harmony, and imagery within minimal code.

 What feature did you enjoy building the most?
Designing that **hero section with the `.card` image panel** was the highlight. Getting the background image, overlay tag, rounded corners, and soft shadows to look cozy and inviting felt like building a set piece. It was borderline obsession, and damn if it didn’t look like a scene out of Pinterest.

 What would you add next if you had more time?
1. Turn the “Reserve” button into a functional **JS modal form** (name, email, time) that saves data.
2. Hook it up to something lightweight — say, a JSON “backend” via GitHub Actions or a serverless function — so I can actually collect fake reservations.
3. Polish and swap out the placeholder image for photographer-credited visuals or local shots.
4. Add a small **“Our Story” About section** with draggable UI elements or micro interaction animations (hover glows, parallax scroll).
